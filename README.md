## What Does It Do?

The script processes datasets to unearth Marvel characters who are least connected to their peers. Whether by choice or destiny, these characters have the fewest connections, making them the true enigmas of their world.

## Features

- Efficient Data Processing: Uses PySpark for lightning-fast data crunching.
- Readability: Joining of datasets provides an easy-to-read output of character names.
- Precision: Only the top 50 characters with the minimum number of connections are displayed.

## Prerequisites

- **PySpark**: You need to have PySpark installed and configured.

## Getting Started

1. Ensure PySpark is up and running:
```
pip install pyspark
```

2. Set the data paths:
Modify the paths to `file:///SparkCourse/Marvel-names.txt` and `file:///SparkCourse/Marvel-graph.txt` within the script to the locations of your datasets.

3. Dive into the shadows:
```
python marvel_loners.py
```
